### Chosen Idea: Website to store users lists
####Site Owner:
As the developer of this site, I want a site that meets the criteria for a
project assigned for the completion of an Data-Centric Milestone Project. The
site should allow the users to create a list of media that they would like to
consume. The list will contain various info about the list itself and about the
individual entries.

### User Stories
The below user stories are for the website <SiteName>. This purpose of the site
is to allow users to be able to create, edit, and view lists and be ale to keep
track of the entries on the list.
